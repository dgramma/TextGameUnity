You wake up tied to a table in the middle of a dark room with a light in your face. A smelly unkept man stares over you. He starts to speak.

"Now that you're awake, welcome to Gadgetsville.
What is Gadgetsville? Where is Gadgetsville? Don't worry about those questions.
The only thing you need to know is you aren't leaving this room alive..."

| What would you like to do? |
Spit in the man's face
Tell him how bad he smells
Ask him to untie you
Yell as loud as you can
